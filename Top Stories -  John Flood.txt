*Markets Right Now…

*10 Things You Shouldn’t Miss This AM…
1) Japan’s Q1 GDP comes in solidly above the Street consensus at +1.6% (the Street was
modeling +0.8%) thanks to strong consumer spending. WSJ
2) China’s new home prices for April comes in +0.32% M/M, down from the +0.44%
number posted in March. WSJ
3) UBS projects a massive accounting gain from its takeover of Credit Suisse, with the
combined firms' "negative goodwill" seen boosting reported profit by $34.8 billion. On the
downside, UBS estimates litigation, regulatory matters and related liabilities may take $4
billion out of capital over 12 months. BBG
4) House Democrats plan to begin collecting signatures Wednesday for a discharge petition
to raise the debt ceiling, a long-shot parliamentary maneuver designed to circumvent House
Republican leadership and force a vote. WSJ
5) US oil/gas drilling is starting to dip amid subdued prices, creating headwinds for the
equipment industry (and potentially leading to higher energy prices down the board). FT
6) The FTC’s lawsuit to block AMGN-HZNP is the first time in more than 10 years that the
gov’t has tried to stop a drug merger (the FTC warned on Tues that “rampant consolidation”
in the industry was pushing up prices). FT
7) Western Alliance provided some encouraging statistics around deposit dynamics. Overall
deposits stabilized during the final days of March and have resumed a growth trajectory
since. QTD deposit growth is north of $2B as of May 12. In addition, insured deposits are

now nearly 80% of the total, while the company is making progress repositioning its
balance sheet. RTRS
8) TGT: Stock is down in the pre-market on the 2Q guide but our desk thinks they did what
they needed to do with 1Q good enough and 2Q possible conservative (we’ll see more on
that from the call). 2Q EPS of $2.05 vs Consensus $1.77 and EBITDA 12% better. Total sales
were in-line, with comps of 0% (traffic was +0.9% vs Consensus +1% (bogey was for
around a 0% to +0.5%, so this was about in-line and while nothing special, is no worse than
feared). Gross margins missed by 40 bps but SG&A beat by a sizeable 150 bps. Guided 2Q
EPS below at $1.30-$1.70 (Consensus $1.91) and comps of down low-singles (Consensus
+0.2%). Encouragingly, inventory down 17% y/t vs -3% last quarter, reaffirming the FY
guide, which could be considered a bit conservative after today’s beat (but early to say).

9) Tesla's CEO Elon Musk said the electric-car maker will dabble in advertisements, a major
shift for the company that’s largely avoided traditional marketing. “We’ll try a little
advertising and see how it goes,” Musk said Tuesday at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting,
in response to an investor’s question. BBG
10) S&P 500 margins are back at pre-COVID levels and rose sequentially in 1Q 2023...(GIR)
