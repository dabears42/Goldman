S&P -64bps closing @ 4,109 w/ an $ insignificant MOC. NDX +09bps @ 13,426,

9.3b shares traded across all US equity exchanges vs ytd daily avg of 11.3b
shares. Our desk was a 6 on 1 – 10 scale in terms of overall activity levels.
A better than expected rebound in retail spending, but it’s certainly not getting
much excitement given the data is backwards looking and not the narrative
we’re hearing from companies – our US Retail Basket finished down -2.8%
today (GSXURETL). The sales report was strong and arguably helps the
hawkish fed narrative a bit. Retail sales increased 0.4% (mom sa) in April,
reflecting an increase in auto sales (+0.4%), a surprising decline in gasoline
station sales (-0.8%), and a larger than expected 0.7% increase in core retail
sales (ex. autos, gasoline, and building materials). Industrial and
Manufacturing production also came in much stronger than expected on both
measures. Following yesterday’s data, we boosted our Q2 GDP tracking
estimate by two tenths to +2.0% (qoq ar) and our past-quarter GDP tracking
estimate for Q1 by three tenths to +1.4%. Our Q2 domestic final sales growth
forecast stands at +1.9%.
Overall executed flow on our desk ended with a -510bps sell skew vs 30d avg
of +123bps. On the back of stronger econ data yesterday morning, we saw an
uptick in rates and risk off in speculative/most shorted complexes. Retail also
traded very heavy (QRTEA -13%, QUOT -7.6%, SFIX -8%, ETSY -5%, EBAY 4.6%). The increase in questions on the move lower is indicative that people
are running more long risk than they have been (we saw this in our PB stats
last week - long buys outpaced short covers ~5 to 1, largest notional long
buying in 7 weeks, though Net leverage is still running super lean in the 7%
percentile on a 3-yr lookback).
Yesterday was another day of Mega Cap tech out-performance. MAGMA
accounted for ~144% of the S&P move with AMZN (+2%), GOOGL (+2.6%),
NVDA (+2.5%), MSFT (+75bps) continuing to benefit from somewhat of a
TINA type behavior. L/Os finished -15% better for sale, driven by trims in
Health Care, Staples, and Industrials. HFs finished 130bps better to buy,
driven by covers in HC on the back of Arb related weakness.
Arbitrage Pain: HZNP (-15%) was the entire focus ytd morning after headlines
hit that the FTC expects to file a lawsuit to block Amgen’s (AMGN) ~$30 billion
acquisition. Investors were questioning impact/read-thrus to the broader arb
space and pharma/biotech M&A in general. Risk remains acute for now with
spillover only to PFE’s $40bn acquisition of SGEN (-6%). Amgen response to
FTC, “we remain committed to completing this acquisition and intend to work
with the court on a schedule that would allow the transaction to close by midDecember."
ADRs: Tons of inbounds on the magnitude lower on weaker prints, which
suggests the space is more crowded than people appreciate. SE (-18%) posted

revs short of expectations. IQ (-8%) and TME (-3.5%) both underperformed
despite legitimately strong prints as investors appear as though they were
hoping to take profits on strength after EPS. BIDU, where we know positioning
has lightened up, outperformed despite a good but not great quarter (+4%).
HD: Finished just -2% on their worst comp in 14 years. We think most
investors actually understand the move, even if they’re skeptical of it. Short
interest is at 6 year highs and it had underperformed LOW by 1000 bps
YTD. We did not see core holders add on weakness. Do think investors get the
move, but think it will have a hard time actually going notably higher, since
tone was more cautious and valuation somewhat full.
TGT: We think the set-up here leans modestly short, but believe both bulls and
bears seem very nervous. We think most HF’s lean negative for this quarter,
given the big share losses to WMT, who is comping much higher. However, we
think most want to flip this and go long into 2Q, as that is when they’ll lap the
inventory issues from last year and the easy -890 bps gross margin compare.
(reports today pre-mkt)
TJX: Expectations are for a clear beat, unlike the lower expectations for their
top peers BURL and ROST. For 1Q, most expect 1Q comps of +4% vs consensus
+2.7% (which is pretty good, given most expect ROST and BURL to both miss).
EPS $0.75-$0.80, about $0.05-$0.10 of upside. Likely reaffirm or tweak the
guide slightly higher. (reports today pre-mkt)
Derivs: The street continues to get lifted on wingy VIX upside, something to be
mindful of if we do get any vol shock around the debt limit. In micro vol, we
continue to see upside interest in TMT / AI-exposed names i.e. AMD, AMZN,
etc. as the macro backdrop continues to be supportive for large cap Tech and
these stocks continue to break thru technical levels. Our consumer pad was
also active in Retailers around earnings this week, notably in TGT which
reports today. Implied move is ~6%. We’ve seen clients buy short dated calls /
call spread collars ahead of the print. Consensus view is TGT positioning
skews negative so some clients believe risk/reward is higher on a better-thanfeared print given the low bar and likely cover bid.
Debt Limit: Democratic President Joe Biden and top congressional Republican
Kevin McCarthy edged closer to a deal. After an hour of talks, McCarthy, the
speaker of the House of Representatives, told reporters the two sides
remained far apart on an agreement to lift the debt ceiling. But he said, “It is
possible to get a deal by the end of the week. It’s not that difficult to get to an
agreement.” Biden and McCarthy named their top negotiators, Biden will even
cut his G7 trip short in hopes of closing a deal before June 1st. Investors
rightfully have been jittery about the unimaginable, however - per Treasury
Sec Yellen: “We are already seeing the impacts of brinksmanship: investors
have become more reluctant to hold government debt that matures in early
June.”

S&P Net Profit Margins …..

Euro-zone industrial production slumped by 4.1% in March from the previous month —
its biggest decline since July 2022. The largest contractions were seen in Ireland and
Germany, the motor of the region’s economy. When broken down by category, by far the
most significant drop was from capital goods, whose production fell by 15.4% on the
month.

Foreign funds have accelerated buying of Indian stocks, pouring in more than $1 billion
in each of the past three weeks, as Asia’s fastest-growing economy is seen as a safe
haven amid concerns of a global slowdown. The strongest inflow to Indian equities
since last August comes amid disappointment over China’s economic recovery as well as
fears that an impending recession in the US may pressure corporate earnings in exportfocused economies including Taiwan and South Korea.
